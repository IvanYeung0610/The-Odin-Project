        <h1>Blog</h1>
        <p> To get some practice working with text in HTML, create a plain blog article page which uses different headings, uses paragraphs, and has some text in the paragraphs bolded and italicized. You can use <strong>Lorem Ipsum</strong> to generate dummy text, in place of real text as you build your sites. VS Code includes a shortcut to generate lorem ipsum for you. To trigger the shortcut, type <em>lorem</em> on the line where you want the dummy text, then press the Enter key, and voila, you have generated dummy text without a hitch. </p>
        <p>This is an original paragraph</p>
